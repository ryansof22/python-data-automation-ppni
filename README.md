# Python Data Automation: Unstructured to Structured Data

## 📌 Project Background
Working with messy data is a common challenge for Data Professionals. This project showcases a Python-based solution to transform "unstructured" vertical CSV entries into a clean, professional, and audit-ready Excel report.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Smart Parsing:** Uses flexible keyword mapping to extract fields (Name, ID, Organization, etc.) from disorganized rows.
- **Visual Data Audit:** Automatically applies cell styling (Red/Yellow) to highlight rows with missing information, enabling faster data verification.
- **Automated Dashboard:** Generates dynamic Bar Charts for organizational distribution and data health metrics in a separate sheet.
- **Data Privacy:** This repository only contains the script logic. No real-time personal data is uploaded to maintain confidentiality.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and logic.
- **Openpyxl:** For advanced Excel styling and chart automation.
